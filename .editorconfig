# "EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. 
# The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins 
# that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. 
# EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
